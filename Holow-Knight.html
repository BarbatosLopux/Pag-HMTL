        <h3>The history of Hallownest</h3>
        <p>
            Before the realm of Hallownest, there existed an all-powerful creature, The Radiance, which through its light gave birth to the tribe of Moths. 
            Together, they created the kingdom of Hallownest, a place for insects to live out their lives. Insects of all kinds soon arrived. The Mantis tribe, a warrior people, and the Bee tribe, a hierarchical society, were among the many species that came to the new realm. 
            While they respected The Radiance as the ultimate authority, the Mantis had their own government, and the bees secluded themselves in their hive, oblivious to all that transpired in Hallownest. All was peace and harmony, or so it seemed. In reality, The Radiance was a parasite that exploited the weak minds of the insects who worshipped her, for her own ends. In return, she granted them the wishes they sought. This was already significant, even if the insects remained unaware, and those who did realize it often didn't care. Their possessed minds weren't a problem compared to the wishes they obtained. 
            No one cared until a being arrived that would change everything.

        <h3>The infection</h3>
        <p>
            The Radiance had been plotting her revenge all this time, and she succeeded. She once again exploited the minds of weak insects, who, even if they forgot her, remembered the pleasure they felt when receiving wishes. 
            She appeared to them in dreams, and over time, the dreams became more frequent and painful. It was like an infection. Eventually, the poor insects couldn't take it anymore and went mad, becoming aggressive and stronger. 
            The dream was so potent that it took on a physical form, like a mucus or orange liquid (visible in Infected Crossroads), and spread through the air. The more privileged tribes and insects with stronger minds managed to survive, although some couldn't resist the temptation of possessing such power. 
            The Radiance was no longer content with ruling minds; now, she wanted to destroy everything. 
            It seemed all was lost.
            The King attempted to find a solution to this plague, believing that to overcome the light, darkness was required. Thus, he ventured into the Abyss and began experimenting with it to forge a pure vessel. He needed to create something capable of containing the infection within, and as the Void was emptiness, he harnessed it to attempt to forge a being fit for this purpose. His initial experiments didn't yield favorable results, nor did his subsequent ones. It took many years for him to discover a pure vessel, while the Radiance threatened to annihilate the insects.
            Until one day, he succeeded.

        <h3>The Hollow Knight</h3>
        <p>The Hollow Knight He created the perfect vessel, or so he believed. It was the Hollow Knight, or the Empty Knight. The King needed a being incapable of feeling, and this one appeared to fit the bill. The Hollow Knight absorbed the Radiance, and she became trapped in its mind, like in a dream. To ensure security, the King enlisted three beings of great power to become the seals that would contain the Hollow Knight, in case something went awry. They were Monomon, the Teacher, who held vast wisdom and studied extensively in the archives. There was also Lurien, the Watcher, who kept watch over the City of Tears from his Tower and, out of loyalty to his king, accepted this sacrifice. Lastly, Herrah, the Beast, queen of the creatures of Deepnest, initially unwilling to sacrifice herself, but after striking a deal with the king, she acquiesced. The three became the Dreamers, sleeping eternally, and from their dreams, they kept the Hollow Knight in check. 
         Time passed, and the King died, the Pale Lady hid away, and the group of the Five Knights disbanded. And even though everything was supposed to be under control, there was something that kept people uneasy. As mentioned before, the Hollow Knight was not perfect. It did possess a feeling, loyalty toward the king. The king treated the Hollow Knight as if it were his child, and it developed an attachment to the king. This showed that the Empty Knight wasn't so empty after all. The Radiance seized upon this and spread once more. Not even the Dreamers could stand against her, but they couldn't awaken because they now had to keep the Hollow Knight imprisoned. The Hollow Knight's void was filled with infection, and now she controlled its body, using it as a conduit. If the Hollow Knight were to escape, the infection would spread even faster. The weak insects became infected once again. The kingdom fell back into ruin, and without their king, their hopes dwindled.
         And at this point is when our character arrives in Hallownest, another vessel that must carve a path through this devastated realm to either replace the Hollow Knight as a pure vessel or put an end to the Radiance once and for all.</p>

        <h1>MAP</h1>
        <p>In Hollow Knight, a valuable ally is undoubtedly a comprehensive map, as the level design showcases a labyrinthine nature and the extensive world layout can easily lead us astray in the depths of Hallownest. Navigating through these unfamiliar terrains can sow uncertainty regarding our goals and destinations. As we progress in our adventure, we will come across a variety of challenging bosses, collectible items of all sorts, intriguing missions, picturesque shops, needy rescued grubs, ornamental trinkets, hidden rarities, empowering abilities, magical spells, as well as strategically placed fast travel points, among many other things. This wealth of elements can result in us inadvertently overlooking certain aspects, prompting us to invest hours meticulously exploring the map in search of the final details necessary to achieve the coveted 107% completion.</p>
